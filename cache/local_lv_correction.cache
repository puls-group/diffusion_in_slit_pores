# This is the local cache file for already calculated entries of the universal correction function of LV-like interface slices R_LV(\nu,q).
#
# The most relevant columns are the first three:
# The first column is the value of q=d_mol/L, the relative deformation amplitude 
# The second column is the value of \nu = D_mol / D_\perp, the relative deformation diffusion speed
# The third column is the derived value of R_LV(\nu,q)
# The fourth column is for debugging, denoting how much time has been simulated before applying the long-term extrapolation. It is provided as a relative scale based on the SPM lifetime prediction for an LV slice
# The fifth column denotes how many real-world seconds it took to simulate the EPM system to calculate R_LV(\nu,q)
#
# The script written to calculate these values as well as stitch these cached values together for better usability can be found in ./scripts/bulk_correction_function.py
